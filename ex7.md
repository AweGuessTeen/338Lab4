Exercise 7:

1.
The time complexity of the provided reverse() implementation is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because for each element in the original list, the function iterates over the list to create a new node and adjust the pointers.
Inside the loop, the get_element_at_position(pos) method is called, which has a time complexity of O(n) as it traverses the list to find the node at the specified position.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2) as the loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, there is a nested traversal of the list.

2.
To improve the reverse() function, the key change needed is to eliminate the creation of new nodes and the nested traversal of the list.
Instead, you can iterate through the list once, updating the next pointers of each node to reverse the order.
This eliminates the need for additional memory allocation and reduces the time complexity to O(n).
Specifically, you should replace the current implementation inside the loop with a single pass iteration through the list,
updating the next pointers of each node to point to the previous node.
